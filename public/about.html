<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm Diana. I am learning how to code. This is part of my portfolio.
  Hopefully, you are able to see the different projects I have been working on.
</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the Movie Ranking Project, where I list some of my favorite movies. It's not a very lengthy list, but they are some of my favorites.
  Maybe you can check them out and see if you also enjoy them!
</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the Birthday Card Project, where I invite you to my birthday party. Do we share a birthday?
  Bonus if you also enjoy tacos!
